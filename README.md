# RockPaperScissors
A project to practice my JS.

Takes input from the user via a pop-up (code must be run via game() command in browser dev tools). Input is checked to make sure it is either rock, paper, or scissors. Then, five rounds are played against a computer and a score is given to determine who won.

Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages).
